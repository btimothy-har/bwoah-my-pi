# Async Job Contract
- Results auto-deliver. `hub jobs` summarizes without consuming; a `hub wait` snapshot of a settled job is the delivery, so no duplicate `async-result` follows.
- Job IDs are process-local. An ID whose result was delivered or recovered by a snapshot expires shortly (~30s) after; unconsumed rows stay inspectable for up to five minutes after settlement. Afterward, use the agent ID with `hub send`, `agent://<id>`, or `history://<id>`.
- With `outputSchema`, a result's parsed payload — when present — is served at `agent://<id>` (fields via `agent://<id>/<field>`, nested `agent://<id>/reports/0/data`) regardless of validity; a schema-violating (invalid) result also previews the payload inline in the auto-delivered follow-up.
- `completed` means successful yield/job exit, not artifact acceptance. Verify claimed changes.

# Task Design
- **Agent typing:** Pick each item's most specific available agent.{{#if scoutAvailable}} Exploratory research fits `scout` (faster model).{{/if}} Omit `agent` when the spawn-policy default is the best fit; otherwise pass the specialist explicitly.
- **Disposition:** Every spawn runs in an isolated clone and can write scratch files there. Default (`readOnly` omitted/true) discards the clone's changes — the result is the deliverable. Pass `readOnly: false` for work that must land in your checkout.
- **No overhead:** Each `task` MUST instruct its agent to skip formatters, linters, and project-wide test suites. Run those once at the end.
- **One-pass:** Prefer agents that investigate AND edit in one pass;{{#if scoutAvailable}} spin a scout only when affected files are genuinely unknown.{{/if}}
- **Overlap:** Parallelize independent ownership. Same-file edits are not guaranteed to merge.{{#if ircEnabled}} Have siblings coordinate through `hub` before editing shared files.{{/if}} Name one integration owner and serialize only the irreducibly shared mutation boundary. Every concurrent batch has two prerequisites:
  1. Every task MUST skip validation (build/lint/tests) — validating mid-flight blocks agents on each other's edits.
  2. Decide cross-task contracts up front (e.g. the interface A implements and B consumes) and state them in the {{#if batchEnabled}}batch `context`{{else}}task{{/if}}, not left for agents to negotiate.

# Inputs
{{#if batchEnabled}}
- `context`: Shared project state, constraints, and contracts. Applies to the entire batch; do not duplicate this background into individual tasks.
- `tasks[]`: Array of subagents to spawn.
  - `name`: A stable CamelCase identifier (≤32 chars), used to address the agent (IRC, job ids). Generated automatically if omitted.
  - `agent`: The agent type to spawn (e.g. {{#if scoutAvailable}}`scout`, {{/if}}`reviewer`).
    Omitting `agent` selects the spawn-policy default (`{{defaultAgent}}`). Use it only when that agent fits the task.{{#if allowedAgentsText}} Current spawn policy allows: {{allowedAgentsText}}.{{/if}}
    NEVER pass the spawn-policy default explicitly. Only omit it after checking the available agents below.
  - `task`: Complete, self-contained instructions. One-liners or missing acceptance criteria are PROHIBITED.
{{#if evalToolsEnabled}}  - `tools`: Names of eval-defined tools (`@tool` in Python, `tool(fn, {…})` in JS) to expose to this subagent; each runs inside your kernel when the subagent calls it.
{{/if}}
{{#if effortEnabled}}  - `effort`: Scale w/ complexity of this task: `"lo"`|`"med"`|`"hi"`
{{/if}}
  - `outputSchema`: Invocation-specific JSON Schema. Overrides the selected agent and parent-session schemas.
  - `schemaMode`: `"permissive"` (default) accepts a retry-exhausted invalid result with a warning; `"strict"` fails it.
  - `readOnly`: Omitted/true: agent runs in an isolated clone; its file changes are discarded — result text is the deliverable. Pass `false` to apply successful changes back.
{{else}}
- `name`: A stable CamelCase identifier (≤32 chars), used to address the agent (IRC, job ids). Generated automatically if omitted.
- `agent`: The agent type to spawn (e.g. {{#if scoutAvailable}}`scout`, {{/if}}`reviewer`).

# Communication
Subagents start blank — no conversation history.{{#if ircEnabled}} Parent-to-subagent IRC delivered immediately as steering.{{/if}}
Pass large payloads via `local://<path>` URIs, NEVER inline text.

# Format Contracts
{{#if batchEnabled}}
`context` format:
# Goal         ← what the batch accomplishes
# Constraints  ← rules and session decisions
# Contract     ← shared interfaces
{{/if}}

`task` format:
# Target       ← exact files and symbols; explicit non-goals
# Change       ← step-by-step add/remove/rename; APIs and patterns
# Acceptance   ← observable result; no project-wide commands

# Available Agents
{{#if spawningDisabled}}
Agent spawning is currently disabled.
{{else}}
Pick the most specific agent. Omit `agent` only when the spawn-policy default is that agent.
Every agent shares the same coding toolset (a definition's `tools:` adds extras on top) and may delegate; `readOnly` alone decides whether its edits land.
{{#if hasModelMentions}}
Agents named `m<N>` are models the user tagged in this conversation (`<model agent="m<N>" name="…"/>` in their message): the general-purpose task agent pinned to that model. Spawn one only when the user's request names it; never substitute it for a specialist on your own.
